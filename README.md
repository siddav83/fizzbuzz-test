# Exercises
Create tests for a function called ‘fizzbuzz’
- The fizzbuzz function receives an argument of a number
- When the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, it returns (“FizzBuzz”)
- When the number is a multiple of 3, it returns (“Fizz”)
- When the number is a multiple of 5, it returns (“Buzz”)
- When the number is not a multiple of 3 or 5, it returns the number itself

Use your tests to help write the fizzbuzz function

Extension: go to codewars and find a kata you like and think you could solve 
https://www.codewars.com/dashboard
try to solve it using tdd on your own machine in the same way you did fizz buzz
When you have a thorough test suite submit your answer to codewars and see if your tests were thorough enough.
